## how to get fingers sample 


```
pip install --upgrade azure-cognitiveservices-vision-computervision
```


# Using Azure pay as you ai training custom vision or opencv yolo

Azure and another website outside of Azure called:  <https://www.customvision.ai/projects>  **this is where you do our custom dataset training

### Classification Types
I chose single object per picture, maybe i should have done multi? 
Multiclass (Single tag per image)
after writing this i switched it back to the recommend value of: Multilabel (Multiple tags per image)

### Domains: 
I chose the compact for General (compact) [S1]



# How does copilot recommend computer vision for finger position 

While Azure AI Vision doesnâ€™t directly provide a specific feature for detecting finger positions on a guitar, you can leverage its capabilities to build a custom solution. Hereâ€™s how you might approach it:

## Image Capture:
Capture an image of the guitar neck with the playerâ€™s hand on the fretboard.
Ensure good lighting and clarity to enhance accuracy.

## Preprocessing:
Crop the image to focus on the fretboard area.
Remove any background noise or distractions.

## Object Detection:
Use Azure AI Visionâ€™s object detection capabilities to identify the fret wires and strings.
Detect the position of each fret wire and string intersection.

## Finger Detection:
Train a custom model (using Azure Custom Vision or other tools) to recognize fingers.
Annotate images with finger positions (e.g., index finger on the 3rd fret).
Use the trained model to predict finger positions in real-time images.

## Distance from Fret Wire:
Calculate the distance between each detected finger and the nearest fret wire.
Compare this distance to the ideal position (towards the front of the fret wire) for accurate playing12.

## Feedback and Visualization:
Provide visual feedback to the player, indicating whether their finger placement is optimal.
Highlight any deviations from the ideal position.
Remember that this solution requires custom development and training. You can explore Azure AI Visionâ€™s documentation and tutorials to learn more about its capabilities and how to integrate them into your guitar finger position detection system34. Happy playing! ðŸŽ¸ðŸ¤˜
